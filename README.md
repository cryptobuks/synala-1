Synala
==============

Synala is an excellent, quality self-hosted PHP web based wallet.  Fully supports BIP32, multisig, multiple wallets, watch-only wallet, offline signing, and more.

This repository is obsolete, and no longer being maintained.  For the latest version of Synala, please use the repository at:  https://github.com/envrin/synala/

v0.4 was just released (not on this repo, the new one), which upgrades Synala to support PHP v7.0+ as the mcrypt extension has been depreciated.
